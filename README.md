# Overview

The Student Gradebook is a Java-based application for managing student records and grades. It allows users to add students, assign grades, calculate average grades, and display all student information in a well-structured gradebook format.

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my understanding of Java by building a functional, real-world application. Through this project, I learned to structure code efficiently, implement dynamic user interactions, and utilize Java’s built-in data structures.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
1. Tools Used:

- IntelliJ IDEA: Primary development environment for coding and debugging.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17: Provides the necessary libraries and runtime for Java development.
- Command Line Interface (CLI): For running and testing the program interactively.
2. Programming Language:

- Java: Used for writing the program, demonstrating object-oriented principles.
- Libraries: Standard Java libraries, including java.util.HashMap for data storage and java.util.ArrayList for handling grades.
