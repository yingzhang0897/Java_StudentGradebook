# Overview

The Student Gradebook is a Java-based application for managing student records and grades. It allows users to add students, assign grades, calculate average grades, and display all student information in a well-structured gradebook format.

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my understanding of Java by building a functional, real-world application. Through this project, I learned to structure code efficiently, implement dynamic user interactions, and utilize Javaâ€™s built-in data structures such as Hashmap.
